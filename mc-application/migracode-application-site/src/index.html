<p> Savonlinna, besides its opera festival, is home to a lot of small, seldom known Finnish bands. One of the most popular of these bands is Paavoharju -- an experimental Christian ascetic group. This band is probably more popular abroad than it is in Finland, according to one of the founding members, Lauri Ainala.  <br> <br>

 Lusto -  The Finnish Forest Museum is a national museum displaying the forest industry and forest culture in Punkaharju, Savonlinna. The museum, which opened in 1994, is based on the Finnish Forest Museum Foundation, which was founded in 1988. Lusto is open all year round, and the museum is visited annually by 35,000 to 40,000 visitors. Lusto is also one of the largest specialty museums in Finland. <br>
<br>
The Lusto building has been chosen as a sample of 20th-century Finnish modern architecture, so the museum is also a significant place to visit. The main designers of the building with a concrete frame upholstered in March are architects Rainer Mahlamäki and Ilmari Lahdelma. <br>
<br>      As a national forest specialty museum, Lusto stores material related to forestry and forest management, forest multi-use and forest culture.<br>

Lusto's collections were established in 1991 and are constantly being expanded. There are about 10,000 objects in the collection. The most significant new collection is the large forest machines , which have been collected since 2000. <br>Lusto also has Finland's largest collection of photographs related to the history of forestry and forest use, comprising more than 250,000 images and negatives. <br>

      <h3> St. Olaf's Castle <em>(Olavinlinna)</em> </h3>

      <p>Olavinlinna (also known as St. Olaf's Castle; Swedish: Olofsborg; German: Olafsburg; literally Olof's Castle) is a 15th-century three-tower castle located in Savonlinna, Finland. It is built on an island in the Kyrönsalmi strait that connects the lakes Haukivesi and Pihlajavesi. It is the northernmost medieval stone fortress still standing. The castle forms a spectacular stage for the Savonlinna Opera Festival, held for the first time in the summer 1912. <br> <br>
The fortress was founded by Erik Axelsson Tott in 1475 under the name Sankt Olofsborg in an effort to profit from the political turmoil following Ivan III's conquest of the Novgorod Republic. It was sited in Savonia so as to lay claim to the Russian side of the border established by the Treaty of Nöteborg. <br>
        The castle hosts several small exhibitions, including the Castle Museum which displays artifacts found in the castle or related to it, and the Orthodox Museum which displays icons and other religious artifacts both from Finland and Russia.
<br> <br>
Olavinlinna is the initial model for Kropow Castle in the bande dessinée King Ottokar's Sceptre, an album in the series of Adventures of Tintin created by Hergé.

   <figure><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Saimaan_aalto.jpg" alt="Picture of Lake Saimaa at sunset." width=400> <figcaption> Lake Saimaa at sunset</figcaption></figure> 
  <p> <strong> Saimaa </strong> is a lake located in the Finnish Lakeland area in southeastern Finland. At approximately 4,400 square kilometres (1,700 sq mi), it is the <strong>largest lake in Finland</strong>, and the <strong>fourth largest natural freshwater lake in Europe. </strong>
<br> <br>
The name Saimaa likely comes from a non-Uralic, non-Indo European substrate language.
